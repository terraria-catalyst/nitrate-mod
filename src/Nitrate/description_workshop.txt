[h1]Nitrate[/h1]

Nitrate is an optimization mod for tModLoader. It focuses on increasing and stabilizing frame rates through changes to rendering and update logic. Nitrate does not specialize in any specific areas, and intends to cover the entire game at some point in the future.

[b]NITRATE IS STILL IN ITS EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT; CERTAIN FEATURES MAY BE ENTIRELY INCOMPATIBLE WITH OTHER MODS WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN PERFORMANCE AND ACCURACY. WHILE YOUR SAVES SHOULD BE SAFE, VISUAL DISPARITIES AND CRASHES MAY STILL OCCUR.[/b]
